        Hello again

I am returning to the blogging life of a programmer.
Last year I was busy with my day job, doing cool things with trains, you know. But now I am creating my own startup in the field of dashcams, ADAS and self-driving. And I want to share with you some videos and notes about the adas system under development.

    
    <a href="https://github.com/open-adas"><img src="/assets/images/blogged/sitandwork.jpg" width="500" /></a>

To make it even cooler, I decided to test my ADAS system in one of the most fun racing games ever: Flatout 2.
    
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlatOut_2"><img src="/assets/images/blogged/Flatout2pc.jpg" width="500" /></a>

The main idea of the game is that accidents are encouraged, you get more nitro from them, and therefore it will be doubly interesting, because the algorithm will try to avoid accidents, unlike other participants in the race.

The algorithm is still under development and I will try to create a video for each important step. I will post them twice a week: Monday and Friday.

Some information will be private, because you know, I try to do it for commercial purposes. But I will try to make as many open source projects as possible. And the next two repositories that I'll publish are a client for getting controls and visuals data from classic racing games; and a repository for building a self-driving racing agent from the ADAS unit and some navigational abstraction.

Here you can find my videos from the game.

Later I will add my speech for important videos and make the material look like a lecture.

And wish me luck!
