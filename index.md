### Things that I develop right now



### My favorite libraries, languages, frameworks, standarts and other recomendations

#### Languages

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| Python      | If you know that you want to build something,  if you know how it should look at the end, probably the fastest way to do that - use python. Beautiful, powerful, beautiful. |
| Clojure     | Lisp-like language. Your code is part of data; your data is part of the code. Functional paradigma, metaprogramming, a lot of brackets and big beautiful thinks realized in short, beautiful lines of code. |
| Cython      | You can use python and replace some parts of the code in python-like syntax sugar for pure C language. Pythonic way delicious, hardcore pure C power. |

#### Libraries and frameworks

##### computer vision and machine learning

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| OpenCV      | Just OpenCV. Must have in every computer vision task. |
| PyTorch     | Fashionable, comfortable, powerful and beautiful. |
| Torchvision | Good way for dataset transformations. |

##### web

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| VueJS      | It's like react, but for snobs. |
| Flask      | It's simple when you need to build something simple. It's flexible when you need to build something difficult. |
| axios      | Better then use JQuery for that. |

#### books

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| The Art of UNIX Programming by Eric S. Raymond    | Must have for developers. UNIX-way, KISS, philosophy and the best examples. |
| The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems by Jef Raskin | This book about beauty in program and calculations in interface. One of my favorite books. |
| Data Science from Scratch - O'Reilly Media | Good start for understanding this stuff. |
