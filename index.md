#### Languages

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| [Python](python.org)      | If you know that you want to build something,  if you know how it should look at the end, probably the fastest way to do that - use python. Beautiful, powerful, beautiful. |
| [Clojure](clojure.org)     | Lisp-like language. Your code is part of data; your data is part of the code. Functional paradigma, metaprogramming, a lot of brackets and big beautiful thinks realized in short, beautiful lines of code. |
| [Cython](cython.org)      | You can use python and replace some parts of the code in python-like syntax sugar for pure C language. Pythonic way delicious, hardcore pure C power. |
| [C++](https://isocpp.org/)      | Sometimes you have to do it. |

#### Libraries and frameworks

##### computer vision and machine learning:

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| [OpenCV](opencv.org)      | Just OpenCV. Must have in every computer vision task. |
| [PyTorch](pytorch.org)     | Fashionable, comfortable, powerful and beautiful. |
| [VisionWorks](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/visionworks) | Cool library for computer vision stuff optimized for jetsons. |
| [Open3D](https://open3d.org/) | The 'Open CV' for 3D points cloud. |

##### web:

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| [VueJS](vuejs.org)      | It's like react, but for snobs. |
| [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)      | It's simple when you need to build something simple. It's flexible when you need to build something difficult. |
| [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)      | Better then use JQuery for that. |

#### Books

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| The Art of UNIX Programming by Eric S. Raymond    | Must have for developers. UNIX-way, KISS, philosophy and the best examples. |
| The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems by Jef Raskin | This book about beauty in program and calculations in interface. One of my favorite books. |
| Data Science from Scratch - O'Reilly Media | Good start for understanding this stuff. |
