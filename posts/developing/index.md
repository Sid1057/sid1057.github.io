### Open Source projects which I currently develop

| Name | description |
|------|-------------|
| [Service utils](https://github.com/Sid1057/service_utils) | Simple package for quick and easy microservices logging and configuration.  |
| ClojureScript HTML5 api library | Easy to use some methods of html5 api such a vibration, storage and moreover. |
| [PyTorch Net Wrap](https://github.com/Sid1057/PyTorch-Net-wrap) | Wrapper class for keras-like use of neural networks at the training stage, an automatic study of parameters and implementation of important built-in methods. |


### My favorite libraries, languages, frameworks, standarts and other recomendations

#### Languages

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| [Python](python.org)      | If you know that you want to build something,  if you know how it should look at the end, probably the fastest way to do that - use python. Beautiful, powerful, beautiful. |
| [Clojure](clojure.org)     | Lisp-like language. Your code is part of data; your data is part of the code. Functional paradigma, metaprogramming, a lot of brackets and big beautiful thinks realized in short, beautiful lines of code. |
| [Cython](cython.org)      | You can use python and replace some parts of the code in python-like syntax sugar for pure C language. Pythonic way delicious, hardcore pure C power. |

#### Libraries and frameworks

##### computer vision and machine learning:

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| [OpenCV](opencv.org)      | Just OpenCV. Must have in every computer vision task. |
| [PyTorch](pytorch.org)     | Fashionable, comfortable, powerful and beautiful. |
| [Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/) | Good way for dataset transformations. |

##### web:

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| [VueJS](vuejs.org)      | It's like react, but for snobs. |
| [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)      | It's simple when you need to build something simple. It's flexible when you need to build something difficult. |
| [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)      | Better then use JQuery for that. |

#### Books

| Name          | What and why     |
| ------------- |------------------|
| The Art of UNIX Programming by Eric S. Raymond    | Must have for developers. UNIX-way, KISS, philosophy and the best examples. |
| The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems by Jef Raskin | This book about beauty in program and calculations in interface. One of my favorite books. |
| Data Science from Scratch - O'Reilly Media | Good start for understanding this stuff. |
